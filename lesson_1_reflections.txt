How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	
	Help see changes which possibly are bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	
	Viewing versions to select a previous if actual it's wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Manually it's more flexible but more painstakingly. Moreover, versions automatically saved optimize time of developing.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Cause each version should have its own files related for security or backups in version control systems. On the other hand, each file must treat
	independent from the others like a chaapters of a novel.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Git log to see the basic information about all commits and git diff to see detailed differences between 2 commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	Using the command git checkout and I heard about something called branch.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I don't know why relate git with a text editor especifically. I guess ease manage version control
